# frisco-day

This repository automatically updates our site for Frisco Day.

If you have write access to it, you can add and edit text files to your heart's content. They'll be immediately visible at <http://callitfris.co>.

To add binary files (ie. images) you will have to clone the repository, add the image and push it. It sounds like a palaver, but if you use the [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) it is pretty straightforward.
