	For too long, the Bay Area has been torn apart by one very important question:<br><br><i>How should you abbreviate San Francisco?</i><br><br>
	"San Fran" is much too nasal. "SF"? It's the opposite of mellifluous.  "Paris of the West"? I mean... okay.
	It's all been so confusing. Until now.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Let's call it Frisco.</h2><br>
	<p>
	Frisco's roots - in Gold Rush California - are as deep and nuanced as the city itself. It's the chosen nickname of Jack London and Otis Redding; Irving Berlin and '90s Bay Area rappers; sailors and the Hells Angels; the vital blue collar core of our city. It's fast. It flows off the tongue. It pisses off tech bros. It is, in fact, totally fucking awesome.

	That's right, San Francisco, hold onto your hoodies: It's time we reclaim "Frisco" for one and for all.</p>

	<p>Join us January 29th for a special <i>Frisco Day</i> celebration - details to follow.</p>
