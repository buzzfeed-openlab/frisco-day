        For too long, the Bay Area has been torn apart by one very important question:
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>How should you abbreviate San Francisco?</i></p>
        <p>"San Fran" is much too nasal. "SF"? It's the opposite of mellifluous. "Paris of the West"? I mean... okay. It's all been so confusing. Until now.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center">Let's just call it Frisco.</h2>
        <p>Frisco's roots - in Gold Rush California - are as deep and nuanced as the city itself. It's the chosen nickname of Jack London and Otis Redding; Irving Berlin and '90s Bay Area rappers;
        sailors and the Hells Angels; the vital blue collar core of our city. It's fast. It flows off the tongue. It pisses off tech bros. It is, in fact, totally fucking awesome. That's right, San
        Francisco, hold onto your hoodies: It's time we reclaim "Frisco."</p>
        <p>And, yes, look, we know what Herb Caen said. And we're aware of Emperor Norton's fines. But conformity is lame. And honestly, the opposite of the spirit that built this great city.</p>
        <p>So, look, for this one day, January 29, you have a pass. You can call it Frisco. Go ahead! It's fine! Sing John Kanaka, and contemplate the Hells Angels. Call it Frisco, and sit by the Bay. Don't worry, you won't be alone. We'll do it too. </p>

        Frisco Day</i> celebration</A> - details to follow.</p>
